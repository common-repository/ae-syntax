An evolved syntax highlighter.  AE Syntax has grown into <a
href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-code-editor-plus/">WP Code Editor
Plus</a> as an attempt to create a full blown web-based IDE for themes and
plugins.

== Description ==

AE Syntax 3.0 will be the final version of this plugin.  Development efforts
with the community will be focused on <a
href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-code-editor-plus/">WP Code Editor
Plus</a> as an IDE.


== Installation ==

1. Upload zip contents to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

(No configuration necessary at this point)


== Screenshots ==
1. Example of editing a JavaScript file with code completion.
2. Example of CSS
3. Example of PHP on Twenty Ten's header.php file


== Changelog ==

= 1.0 =
First release of my first public plugin -- Biggest challenge is validating the
readme.

= 1.1 =
Thanks to <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/profile/pothi">pothi</a> for
identifying a display issue where the editor's internal divs inherited a 190px
margin-right.  Now I have something to add to my <a
href="http://wordpress.org/extend/kvetch/">Kvetch</a>.  Also important in this
release is a known "issue" or feature that doesn't appear to be working.

I have attempted to integrate jQuery UI's <a
href="http://jqueryui.com/demos/resizable/">Resizable</a> to the editor so
users can size their own editor as well.  It produces no JS errors, and
created the nested divs and CSS classes necessary, but does not resize.  I
have used wp_enqueue_script() to queue up jQ-ui-core, ui-widget, ui-mouse and
ui-resize.  My guess is it is an inherited style that is hiding the resize
handle.  If someone wishes to contribute a few lines of CSS to make the handle
show up in the right place, that would be wonderful.  It should be fixed in
v.1.2.

= 2.0 =
Rebrand!  The project has gained direction and scope and is no longer just for
highlighting syntax, but now going the direction of an entire IDE replacement
able to do anything you can online that you could do offline, or via ssh.  I
have always been a firm believer that "one should never edit code directly on
the server" -- My goal is now to change that mindset, turning the production
server/webpage into a production environment as well as a development and
staging environment.  Through revisions, output buffers, the sick hooks
everywhere... why not.  If theme test drive can do it with themes, why can't
there be an all inclusive web based IDE.  (Death to Desktop Applications! Viva
platform independant code!).

= 3.0 =
No coding change, just changed the name back due to upgrade issues.
Attempting to upgrade via the plugin panel was a big fail.  I have learned a
lot about scope and planning with my first plugin, and will do a lot better
with the next one.
